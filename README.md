Unity version: 6000.0.23f1

I was inspired by the game Last Day on Earth and decided to make a similar project, 
but instead of humans and zombies, different tanks drive around and perform their roles. 
The project includes: 
- an inventory system,
- item pickup, basic
- enemy AI, 
- an ore smelting system, 
- a tank research branch, 
- a tank upgrade system, 
- a basic map with scene loading,
- part of the combat system.
